almost a year into the programme inspite of the pre-Coronavirus slowdown in growth, especially in the large-scale manufacturing sector.\nWith respect to the real sector the SBP deemed it appropriate to add a special section titled state of competition in Pakistan.\nThis does need to change and the central bank did well to bring this issue to foreground.\nWe are sure that the central bank does realise that the changed scenario dominated by the pandemic and its concomitant imperatives dictate obtaining major concessions from the IMF in the ongoing programme as mere tweaking of some of the
