little over a week about a child dying from the flu.Last Monday, a boy under age 1 died of the flu in northwest Harris County , which experts said was the county's first flu-related pediatric death for the flu season beginning Oct. 1, 2019.Doctors are urging residents to get a flu shot to protect themselves and their families.The agency recommends anyone six months of age and older get a flu shot every year.Flu season can last as late as May.Symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle or body aches and fatigue, though doctors warn not everyone who has the flu will have a
