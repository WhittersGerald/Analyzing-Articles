(IHV) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and scientists from Trieste, Italy announced today the characterization of a novel mutation in the RNA polymerase of certain viral strains of SARS-CoV-2 carried by patients located in Europe and North America.\nIn addition, different patterns of mutations were identified in viral strains corresponding to different geographical areas.\nThe findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is quickly evolving and different European, North American and Asian strains may coexist, however, more research is needed to identify the biological significance of these mutations.\n\"We need to understand the biological and medical significance of the mutations,\" said Davide Zella, PhD, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and member, Global Virus Network.\n\"We will continue to collaborate with our Italian colleagues to identify viral mutations in this
