Home EntertainmentThere is no logical reason whyhas entered the Christmas film canon.\nThe 80-year-old Judy Garland vehicle following a young girl\u2019s journey through the fantasy land of Oz has zero mentions of the holiday, and its tornado-centric plot suggests a time of year far warmer than a Kansas December.Nevertheless, the film persists as a delicacy that, while available year round, somehow feels special during the holiday season \u2014 like tins of popcorn or the inevitable pair of socks received from a distant relative.The San Antonio Symphony will accompany a screening of the film with a live music performance of its Oscar-winning soundtrack, bringing the thrill of live instrumentals to a film that still packs on the charm decades after its original release."}]
